List of features



Find bus lines near me:

concept piece for mobile
   - Show me where you are  (click on the map?)  (this step eliminated when truly mobile)
    	- webpage asks for your location. (if not in SF, or if user denied to share location, or if not within x distance of active bus) you get a message explaining why you need to click to tell it your location.  Again its a concept piece.
   - Now tell me where you want to go
   - shows all bus routes that can get you to within x distance of there. 
       - uses predictions
       - highlights stops nearby
       bounding box to show all buses within 10 minutes (20 minutes) by default.  your local and relevant view

3. Zooming map
  - should the zoom modify the projection parameters directly?




1. Support errors from NextBus feed
  - special attention to "should-retry" parameter

	 <body>
		 <Error shouldRetry="true">
		 Agency server cannot accept client while status is: agency
		 name = sf-muni,status = UNINITIALIZED, client count = 0, last
		 even t = 0 seconds ago Could not get route list for agency tag "sf-muni".
		 Either the route tag is bad or the system is initializing.
		 </Error>
	 </body>


2. Lets start with one route.  We'll give each vehicle along the route a marker on the map.
