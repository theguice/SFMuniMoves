Frontend Coding Challenge
===========================
ThousandEyes Frontend Coding Challenge:

For this project, you will be using d3.js (http://d3js.org) to draw the real-time positions of San Francisco's buses and trains (SF Muni).

1. First of all, you will need a base map of San Francisco. This zip file contains a few different versions in GeoJSON format:

2. You should draw the vehicle locations on top of the map, dynamically updating their locations every 15 seconds. The instructions for using the real-time data feed are here:
http://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf

Feel free to get creative with how you draw the vehicles, how you transition them to their latest positions, what other data you incorporate besides the coordinates, and so on.

3. Provide a separate HTML control for selecting a subset of routes (the "routeTag" attribute in the data), e.g. show only "N" and "6".

Feel free to add any additional controls or interactive elements you think might be useful.

In addition to d3, you are also welcome to use AngularJS (including AngularUI), JQuery, and/or Bootstrap.

Note that the NextBus server allows AJAX requests from all origins, so you can fetch the data directly from your JavaScript code.

Important: We strongly suggest you host the app in the cloud so we can test it easily.
